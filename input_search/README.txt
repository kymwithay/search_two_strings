UPDATES and CHALLENGES:
Since none of my code was functional, I started over. I created a whole new
cordova project called input_search. I was able to finally implement the search
with two strings in assignment 4. I got that working and then was
able to use that code and put it into a HTML template to complete
and finish Assignment 5. I got that working and then was finally
able to start Assignment 6.

Challenges I faced were identified syntax errors. I would use
double quotes where single quotes were needed. Or I would
miss a } or ) to close a function. The biggest challenge I
faced was identifying where to call the input first name and
last name in the FindByName function in Assignment 4 to filter
and display the results. I set the input tags as classes instead
of ids, even though I in my javascript I had them as ids.
